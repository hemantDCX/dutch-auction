A Dutch auction (also called a descending price auction) refers to a type of auction in which an auctioneer starts with a very high price, incrementally lowering the price until someone places a bid. That first bid wins the auction (assuming the price is above the reserve price), avoiding any bidding wars. This contrasts with typical auction markets, where the price starts low and then rises as multiple bidders compete to be successful buyers.

Financial markets employ a slightly different variant. There, a Dutch auction happens when investors place bids for a security offering, specifying what they are willing to buy in terms of quantity and price. The price of the offering is then determined after taking in all bids to arrive at the highest price at which the total offering can be sold. Dutch auctions can be used to sell Treasury securities, IPOs, floating-rate debt instruments, and other securities.
